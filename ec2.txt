How to deal with Volumes

root volume : COntains OS : gp2,gp3, io1, io2 and magnetic

IOPS : Input and output Operations per second

GP2, Gp3 : general Purpose :SSD: Suitable for most of the common workloads.
io1, io2 : Provisional IOPS :SSD: Gives best perf among all storage options. 
sc1 ($), st1($$) : HDD : wont support boot/root volume : Best throughput values. : log processing/bigdata/Data Warehousing
magnetic : standard : We dont use this.. : Cheapest storage 

Windows : FAT, NTFS and ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs

EBS : Elastic Bloc Storage : Block based storage : Designed to run OS.. 

root : SSD and magnetic is supported.
Addl volume : SSD, HDD and magnetic

Step: CHoose Storage

--> EBS : Elastic Block Storage
SSD / HDD / Magnetic


root Volume : COntains OS : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 and standard/magnetic
Additional volume : all root supported + st1, sc1

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..

for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.

__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 

io2 Block Express volume : Min : 4 GiB, Max: 64 TiB...
Supports 256,000 IOPS.. 
__

Magnetic : Standard : Less freq accessed data, Low cost storage solutions.. 
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 1 TiB...
__

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : Bigdata, Data warehousing, log processing.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 500.. Throughput : 500 MB/S..

Cold HDD : sc1 : THroughput orientes storages, but with Less Frequently accessed.. Lower cost than st1.. 
Size : Min 125 GiB - 16 TiB.. IOPS : 250.. Throughput : 250 MB/S..


Free Tier : 30 gb Gp2 and standard storage.. 


--> 20% of volume size (or) 5 gb.. WHichever is highest

** Need to perform OS level operations to make additional volumes available.
--> Disk Management --> diskmgmt.msc --> choose volume --> make it online --> Initilize disk --> SImple volume --> NTFS/FAT --> Create


Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs


grab the name of new volume : /dev/xvdb

lsblk		--> List block based devices
df -Th		--> List the available volumes

/dev/xvda1	--> root volume (/)
/dev/xvdf	--> new Volume name 

In windows OS, we mount new volumes to drive letters.. But in Linux OS, We mount volumes to Directory. 

mkdir newvolume

file -s /dev/xvdf  	--> If this command returns with "data", no file system.
			--> If this returns ext3/xfs filesystem.. We have a file system.


mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		--> Make file system and write it to Additonal volume

mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/	--> mount addl volume to directory


=================


--> Above mount is temp mount only.. it won't available after the instance reboot.
--> To make this volume perm mount to the directory, Add entry in "/etc/fstab" file.
--> Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" file. 

--> cat /etc/mtab		--> Grab the entry related to newly added addl volume

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/2gbvol xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0

--> vim /etc/fstab.. Write the above entry, save and quit the editor. (Do not edit the existing entry).

mount -all
__________

--> Increase the volume size the "Cosole" first, then execute the below command..!!

We can use "xfsprogs" to increase existing volume size. 

yum install xfsprogs

--> xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
--> xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume

--> Increasing volume is possible, But redusing volume is not possible.

===========================================================================

Task 1 : 
-> Launch an ec2 instance, 
-> Create a 2 gb additional volume, associate it with ec2 instance.. 
-> Make 2 gb volume available at os level and write some data into it. (Reboot and verify)
-> Reboot instance and enter "df -Th", 
-> Now also it should show 2gb volume with data.


Task 2 : Launch another ec2 instance in same AZ as existing ec2 instance.. Detach the volume from instance 1 and attach it to newly launched ec2 instance. Mount it to new directory. You should be able to see all the data.


==============================================================================================


rough notes :

lsblk
df -Th



Create a volume and attach to your ec2 instance, then run "lsblk" command and get name of your newly atached volume.

/dev/xvdb ==> volume name

file -s volumename => to identify file system presence.

file -s /dev/xvdb

mkfs => Command to create a file system in a volume.

mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdb

mkdir newvol

mount ==> mount a volume to a directory

mount /dev/xvdb newvol/ 

verify it by running "lsblk" and "df -Th". 

----

To make the volume permanent mount, 

Step 1 : After mounting, get the entry from "/etc/mtab" file related to this volume.
Step 2 : Write this entry to "/etc/fstab" file.

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/newvol xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota 0 0

--------

To increase the volume size, First add additional starage at aws console, then increase size at OS level.

run "xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvol/"

--> If our volume is Encrypted, Snapshot also Encrypts automatically. 
--> When we are launching/creating a volume from encrypted snapshot, volume also encrypts automatically.
--> We cannot share an Default Master key Encrypted snapshot.
--> If we are using Custom/customer Managed encryption key, we can share snapshot with another aws account, but we need to provide permissions on encryption key also to another aws account.

Vertical Scaling : Upgrading / Adding more resources to same Instance. i.e; from t2.micro to t3.medium

Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same instance resources.. t2.micro --> c5.2xlarge
Horizantal Scaling : Distribute application load to multiple ec2 instances.. 


To perform vertical scaling in AWS, First stop the ec2 instance, then only we can upgrqade it.


We can create alarms to get notifications via SNS, so that we can take some actions on the resources.


#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
echo "<h1>This is my first webserver</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
echo "<h1>This is my Second webserver</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same instance resources.. t2.micro --> c5.2xlarge


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, while launching pass userdata and deliver webpage.

Task 2 : Create an alarm, when Instance CPU usage is less than 30% for 10 minutes, Stop the instance and get an alart to your email.

Task 3 (optional) : Install stress package on an ec2 instance, run this stress command for 10 min.. 
Now, create an Alarm to monitor your ec2 instance cpu, when cpu usage is 80% or more for 5 min, Reboot your ec2 instance and get an alert to your email.


Real Env process : First we need to create a Change request (technical details of old conf, new config, cost diff, when you perform this(implementation window)).. Change Advisory Meeting/CAB --> once it is approved, we will implement this change.
Over weekends by taking proper downtime.  
-> We will do validations / Sanity check after upgradation.

Vertical Scaling : Upgrading same instance resources.. t2.micro --> c5.2xlarge
Horizantal Scaling : Distribute application load to multiple ec2 instances.. 

Classic ELB : Layer 4/7 LB.. : Outdated.. : http, https, tcp, udp.. 
Application ELB : Layer 7 ELB.. : http and https
Network ELB : Layer 4 ELB.. : TCP, UDP, TLS 
Gateway ELB : GENEVE / 3rd party security virtual applicances.. 


**Please select at least two Subnets in different Availability Zones to provide higher availability for your load balancer.

** Dont use same Security group for your ec2 instance and Load balancer.
** Use Same SG for all EC2 instances delivering same application.


For ELBs, We will get DNS Endpoint.. Not an IP Address

If you want to view IP address of an ELB, 
--> Navigate to "Network interfaces" and observe, You can get IP of ELB.
--> nslookup "ELB-DNS-NAME"


nslookup myappalb-1450403708.ap-south-1.elb.amazonaws.com


___________________________________________________

Target Group : Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create each listener rule, you specify a target group and conditions. When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group.

Application ELB : http and https

Application Load balancing algorithm : 
--> Round robin
--> Least outstanding requests
--> Weighted ***

--> We cannot assign a dedicated IP address for our Application ELB.
--> Application LB Supports path based routing, also supports Microservices.

Network ELB : TCP.. 
--> Flow Hash algorithm.
--> We CAN assign a dedicated IP address for our network ELB. Its not possible for ALB.
--> NLB is capable to handle millions req/sec.

ELB Access Logs : Logging on ELB. Destination is s3.

--> use same SG for all your web servers. Initially open for everyone, then modify it later.
--> Use a diff SG for your load balancer. Open 80 for everyone.

SG pipeline mechanism : open port 80 on your ec2 instances SG, Instead of open for everyone, Add your Load balancer Security group.

=========================================================================================

Launch atleast 2 ec2 instances across 2 AZs.

Task : Create an ALB, and deliver webpage on One TG / Port :80. 
Test Stickyness.


Task 2 : what is Telnet and how to use telnet, test it with an ec2 instance on port 22.

telnet to google on port 443.
telnet to your ec2 instance on port 22 and test it.


================================================


Task 1 : Launch an ec2 instance, make it as webserver, 
Create an ALB, and deliver webpage on TG / Port :80. 

Launch another ec2 instance and configure apache to run on port 8080.

Task 2 : on existing LB, Add listeners on 8080 and test output on 8080.

**Open port 8080 at your ec2 SG and ELb SG.

Task 4 : Make sure you implement Pipeline mechanism.

Task 5 : Configure and deliver NLB.
