====================

S3 : Simple Storage Service :
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS.
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe.
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. use "Service Quota" to incease this limit.
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations.
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is now required region selection. You first need to choose a region, where you want to create your s3 bucket.
--> While creating bucket, we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname (standard URL)
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

======================

5 GB Standard Storage.
2000 PUT Object (Uploads/Month)
20,000 GET object (Downlaod/Open)

Track your free tier usage using below line.
Navigate to "Billiong and cost management", under "cost analysis", we have "free tier"

Enable free tier alerts.
We can configure free tier alerts, to receive notification when your usage is 85% and 100% crossed.
Under "Preferences and Settings", the "Billing Preferences", choose "free tier alerts"


In real env, most of the times we use "S3 Standard" only. 

S3 Storage Classes : 

--> S3 Standard : Defualt storage class for all the data we upload to s3. Data will be available immedeatly.
Designed to store : Frequently accessed data. 
Availability : 99.99%,  Durability: 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Standard-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data
Avai : 99.9%, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> One Zone-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data. Store only non-critical data. Cost less than 40% compared to Standard-IA.
Avai : 99.5 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : 1 AZs

--> Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly Glacier) : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (1 min - 5 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds. 

--> Glacier Deep Archieve : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 hrs. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (5 - 12 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs
..

S3 Intelligent Tier : If we have unknown access pattern, we can choose. 
Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

S3 FREE TIER :
--> 5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT Operations (upload)
--> 20,000 GET operation (open/download)

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

** Only S3 standard comes under free tier eligibility.

===============================

How to make an Object Public.?
1. verify Account level "block public access settings". Turn off
2. verify Bucket lebvel "block public access settings". Turn off, if its enabled.
3. Enable ACLs. Under bucket permisisons, Navigate to "Object Ownership" and enable ACLs.
4. Make object Public using ACLs.

Object URL Syantax: 

http://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname
http://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname

--> versioning helps us to get our data to correct state, AWS maintains multiple copies of our data.
--> If we accedentally overwrite any data or delete any file, we can get it to correct state.

If you are typing "Delete" ==> you'll get delete Marker. 
If you are typing "perm Delete" ==> You wont get Delete marker.

Delete the "Delete Marker" to get your object back.
_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.

--> When versioning is enabled on bucket, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> S3 will show most recent uploaded object only / Current version objects.
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Set Version to SHOW, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.

======================================================================================================


Life Cycle Management Rule : 

--> We can apply Rule to entire bucket
--> We can limit rule to a prefix (Folder)
--> We can limit rule to objects by specifing a "Tag"


S3 Standard --> StandardIA/IT --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Glacier --> Delete
S3 Standard --> Delete


===========

S3 Static Website Hostic : 

--> We need to make data public read, then only our website will deliver. 
--> Purchased Domain name should be same as Bucket name. 

http://learnaws.co.in.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com  ==> learnaws.co.in

http status codes :
2XX : OK/Success
3XX : Redirection
4XX : Client sider error
5XX : Server sider error

Task : Configure life cycle management rule to transit data from S3Standard to "Delete" after 2 days.

Task : Download a template from Internet. Deliver the webiste using s3 - static webiste feature.
