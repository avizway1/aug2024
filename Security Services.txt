Cloudtrail : Logging service. Enabled by default. it stores only last 90 days logs. Create a trail to s3 to store all logs for unlimited days.

-> If you want to setup a retention period for these logs, create a LifeCycle management Rule on S3 bucket. 

• Management events provide information about management operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane operations.

• Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or in a resource. These are also known as data plane operations. Data events are often high-volume activities. Data events can log s3, Dynamodb and Lambda services.

• Insight Events : CloudTrail Insights events capture unusual activity in your AWS account. If you have Insights events enabled, and CloudTrail detects unusual activities.

--> Cloudwatch Agent : We can install cw agent at os level, we can get custom logs of Instance OS. 

** Realtime : We enable trail for all accounts in one AWS Logging account. If any external auditor visits, we can provide access on only logging account.
In Real env: We create a trail for Management, another trail for data and another for insights.

WAF : Web Application Firewall : Application ELB, CLoudfront, API Gateway.. : AWS WAF is a web application firewall service that lets you monitor web requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, an Amazon CloudFront distribution, or an Application Load Balancer. You can protect those resources based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that the requests originate from.

NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY

-->  We can create rules in WAF and apply on top of Application Load balancer / Cloudfront / Api gateway.
