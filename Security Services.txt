• Management events provide information about management operations that are
performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control plane
operations.

• Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or in a
resource. These are also known as data plane operations. Data events are often high-volume activities. Data events can log s3, Dynamodb and Lambda services.

• Insight Events : CloudTrail Insights events capture unusual activity in your AWS account. If you have Insights events enabled, and CloudTrail detects unusual activities.

--> Cloudwatch Agent : We can install cw agent at os level, we can get custom logs of Instance OS. 

** Realtime : We enable trail for all accounts in one AWS Logging account. If any external auditor visits, we can provide access on only logging account.
In Real env: We create a trail for Management, another trail for data and another for insights.
