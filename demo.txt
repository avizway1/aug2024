Cloud computing : you are using someone else computer. 

Definition of Cloud Computing : Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive.

NIST Definition of Cloud Computing : 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Pay-as-go ==> Pay for the resources you are actually using.. 
if you are using a server for 5 min, you will get charged for 5 min only.. 


On-demand self-service : you can choose what service you want to use. you will get charged for the resources you are actually using. you no need to depend on service provider to get these things done.

Rapid elasticity : We can easily Upgrade and downgrade the resources. it wont take much time to perform. 
Example : We can launch server with very small config, if required we can upgrade same server to very high configuration. No need to sped lot of time. no need to worry about hardware dependencies.


t2.micro	: 1 CPU, 1 RAM 
medium		: 2 CPU, 4 RAM
xlarge		: 4 CPU, 16 RAM


Measured Services : Whatever you use, the usage will be measured. (per gb/month, /hr, /sec)

Broad network access & High Availability : Cloud service providers has infra almost across the globe. Instead of spending time and building our own infra, we can use this cloud providers infra and deliver our application quickly.

Resource pooling. : You can use cloud shared tenancy mechanism to save cost. Underlying resources share with multiple customers.

----------------

Pay-as-you-go : pay for the resources you are actually using. 

You used a server for 1 hr in a day = 1 hr cost..

----------------

DEPLOYMENT MODELS :

Public cloud : THis model is open for everyone. Anyone can create an accont and start using. 
Azure, GCP, AWS..  Maintenance : Service provider responsibility. 

Private cloud  : Not open for everyone, Dedicated for only one organisation.  Only that org users / only authorised uses can use. Maint: Your team can fix it / you can take assistance from 3rd party.

Hybrid cloud : Combination of one or more cloud deployment models.. Public + public / Public + private
Existing Servers + creting new svrs in AWS..  Azure + AWS.. 
==> Site-to-site VPN connection, AWS Direct Connect

Community cloud : group of org build the infra together and only that group of org use that infra. main : One of the org from group / 3rd party.

=================================================================================


Service models of Cloud Computing : 

-> IaaS : We need takes care about the OS level onwords. No need to take care about Physical resources.

-> PaaS : Platform as a Service : Moderate efforts.. Our efforts is to design application only, not infra management / configuration management.

-> SaaS : Software as a Service : No efforts / very very less efforts.


Order : SaaS
Dining in rest : PaaS
cooking in existing kitchen : IaaS

Build your kitchen then cook : 


Requirement : I need a website that can be accesable across the globe.!



Self Managed/on-Premise : 

SaaS : Software as a Service : Lightsail : Create and deliver.. (customize if required)
PaaS : Platform as a Service : AWS Elastic beanstalk.. provide my data.. and deliver my website..
IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service : launch ec2 instance/Server.. install webserver.. and create data to deliver..


==========================================================================================

Free Tier : From the day of your account creation , AWS offerig free tier resources for first 12 Months.

s3 : Storager service (AWS Verison of Google Drive)
ec2 : elastic compute cloud : Service to launch and run Servers in aws/cloud.

S3 : 5 gb/Month Free tier.. 2,000 PUT, 20,000 GET Operation /Month.. 
EC2 : 1 ec2 instance ==> 750 Hrs/Month.. 


AWS ; CSP Cloud Service Provider.. 


Why we need to learn only AWS.!  
AWS own 51% market share..

Region : geographical location or Physical location.. No specific boundaries and As of Aug, 2024, we have 33 regions across the globe.. 
--> No technical definiation available for region.

Every Region has a code. 
Mumbai : ap-south-1
Hyd : ap-south-2
Singapore : ap-southeast-1

--> We can choose any region across the globe and we can launch our resources.


Availability Zone / AZs : AZ is nothing but a data center or combination of multiple DCs.
Each AZ is designed to isolate/sustain another AZ failure.

Mumbai : we have 3 AZs.. ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b and ap-south-1c
hyd ; ap-south-2, ap-south-2a, ap-south-2b and ap-south-2c


Edge Location / PoP (point of Presence) : As of Aug, 2024, We have 600+ Edge locations across the globe.

====================================================================================================

D: 


Root User : Unrestricted access on AWS account.
** We dont use this user for day-to-day activities.

Highly recommended to Enable "2/multi factor Authentication" for root user.


IAM User : We always follow "Least privilages mechanism". Using IAM service, We can create users, groups and we can manage user accesses on AWS resources.
-> provide permissions/access that really reqwuired to perform his job duties.
-> 

Storage Administration : IAM User with Username and password : Add permissions to access only Storage


User : Only S3 Access
User : Only ec2 access
User : Provide read only access

====================================================================================================


Root user : When ever you are login using an email id and password, we call that user as "root user". 
==> Root user have unrestricted access on our AWS account.
==> Changing support plan / changing payment methods / closing aws account / transfer account.

We can secure this account by enabling MFA / 2-factor authentication.


IAM User : Identity and Access Management : In IAM, We can create users, groups and we can manage user permissions. 

Policy : Set of permissions on our AWS Services.

--> least privilages mechanism.



Root user : One AWS account can contains only one root user. Reason : We can use only one email id to create an AWS account.
If you are using this email to login to your aws account, you are login as root user.

Why we need an IAM user.

2 AWS guys.. They need a junior guy for monitoring purpose.. 
create an Account for this Jr guy, provide "ReadOnly" access to this user. 

least privilages mechansim: provide permissions to perform his job duties. Do not provide any additional permissions.



--> Are you okay to share "root credentials" to all these guys.???

AWS Administrator : Created and Manages resources. 
Developers : Limited access on specific resources based on project requirement.
DBA : manages Databases, provide access to DBs and takes backup of DB
Support Team : Monitors the resources and alert respectives teams when any resource is over utilised / any abnoramal activity identified.

AWS Admin : Create an IAM user with "AdministratorACcess" Policy.
DBA : create an IAM user with "DBAdminAccess"
Support Team ; Create an IAM user and provide "ReadOnly" access policy.


Authetication : using username and password you can login.
Authorisation : After login, Only some services are allowed, if you try to access any other service, it won;t allow us to access, Denies with "you are not autheorized" to perform this operation.
-> permissions denied / Not allowed to access / not authorized to access.




Step 1 : Enter user Name
Enable "provide access to AWS management console" and choose "I want to create an IAM user"
Enable "Users must create a new password at next sign-in"

Step 2 : Set permissions.

Policy : Set of permisisons on our AWS account.

-> Create a group or add user to an existing group. User gets permisisons from group.
-> COpy permisisons from an existing user.
-> Attach permissions directly to the user.

Attaching "S3FullAccess" policy

Step 3 : Review and create


To Setup an Alias to our aws account, Navigate to IAM Dashboard and scroll down.

current url : 
https://501170964283.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
https://avizway9.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


Task : Create an AWS account and Enable MFA for Root User.
** Setup Account Alias and Custom Password standards.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user in your AWS account, Provide "S3FullAccess" and login as this user, verify his access on S3 platform by creating an S3 Bucket.

Task 3 : Create an IAM user in your accountm, provide "IAM FullAccess" and login as this user, verofy his access on IAM service, by creating another IAM user.

Task 4 : Create an IAM user in your account, provide "AdministratorAccess" and login as this user, verify his access on IAM service and S3 Service, by creating another IAM user and another s3 bucket.
** Try to Verify account information. Allow/Deny.?

Task 5 : Denied ; How to enable billing access to this IAM user.


=================================================================================

D: 08/08/2024

Policy : Writtens in JSON format. Document contains set of permissions on our AWS account.

S3FullAccess : Allow an IAM user to perform anything on s3 service only.
IAMFullAccess : Allow an IAM user to perform any operation on IAM service.
AdministratorAccess : Allow an IAM user to perform any operation on Any Service / Applicaiton available in our AWS account. username : Avinash_T

"AdministratorAccess user" = "root user" WITHOUT account management.


Implicit Allow : 
IAM User is allocated with "S3FullAccess" : he can access only s3 service. Apart from S3 service, he is not allowed to access any other servcies.

Explicit Deny : 

Create an IAM user, provide him all services access, but dont provide "S3Access".


1. AWS managed policy (Based on available Service)
2. AWS Managed - Job Function policy (Based on Standard job roles available in market)
3. Customer Managed (Customer can create based on his cutom requirement)

** We cannot Modify or delete AWS managed polocies.

1. ec2 : ec2readponly, ec2full, ec2poweruser....
2. DBA, DataScientist, PowerUser, Administaror, network Admin.. 


1. I Need a Policy that can allow anything on S3 and ec2 service.. 


Policy contains below components:

--> Service : s3
--> Effect : Allow / Deny : Allow
--> Actions : On (S3) Service, What OPERATIONS you want to take effect (Allow).
--> Resources : Buckets/Folders/files.. : Allow All resources.


Requirement : create a Deny policy for S3 service.

Create an IAM user, Provide him "AdministratorAccess", then will add "DenyS3" policy also.
==> verify s3 is accesable or not.!!


If you allow 100 times and deny 1 time at any level (user/group/resource) ==> DENY will take effect.


Requirement : I need an IAM user, who can read anything from S3 Service, But i dont want to allow him to perform any Weite operaiton on all resources.


===============

Task : Create a Customer Managed policy to "deny s3".

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, provide him "AdministratorAccess" and associate "task 1 policy" to this user, login and try to create a bucket.!!!  
output..?


Task 3 : Create a Policy to allow S3FullACcess, but this should work from only one/your Network.
** You have to add an IP address condition.

115.98.52.35/32


================================================================================================

D: 09/08/2024

Inline Policy : Alligned to single user.
** We use this only in some special cases.
--> Whenever a user is facing max number of polocies atatched issue, or character limit issue.

--> We cannot reuse, Inline polocies.
--> hard to track.


-----------------

How to tack an IAM user activities.?

We can use "Cloudtrail" service. Cloudtrail logs all user activities. We can filter using username / time / Event.
This service is enabled in all AWS accounts defaultly. It can store last 90 days activites.

-----------------

How to track user last loged information (or) MFA status.?

Downlaod "Credentials Report" from your aws account. This report provides "user Last loged-in", "user creation date", "MFA Status" and "Accesskeys status".


ARN : Amazon Resource Name : Unique identity for our aws resources.

-----------------

How to track resources shared from your aws acocunt to another aws account.?

Use "IAM Access Analyser" and we can identify shared resources.
--> External Access Analyzer
--> unused resources analyzer.

-----------------

Permisisons Boundary : This is not a cpommonly used feature. To setup maximum permissions for a user. 



Task : Create an IAM policy to enable MFA. 

Create an IAM user, provide him "S3 Full Access", Now login as this user, Try to enable MFA himself.
Now. Attach the policy you created as part of the task, now try to enable/disable/sync/resync MFA.
